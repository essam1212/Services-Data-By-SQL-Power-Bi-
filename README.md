# ðŸ“Š Service Branch Dashboard â€“ Power BI Data Analysis Project

This project presents a **Service Branch Dashboard** built in **Microsoft Power BI**, connected to a **SQL Server** database.  
It visualizes key performance metrics and business trends for a company providing hourly professional services across multiple regions.

The dashboard delivers interactive insights into **Total Revenue**, **Total Hours Worked**, and detailed breakdowns by **Department**, **Client**, **Region**, and **Month**.  
Using SQL queries for data aggregation and Power BI visuals such as bar charts, donut charts, and line graphs, raw data was transformed into meaningful business insights.
