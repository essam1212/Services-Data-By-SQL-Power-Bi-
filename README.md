Service Branch Dashboard â€“ Power BI Data Analysis Project

This project presents a Service Branch Dashboard built in Microsoft Power BI, connected to a SQL Server database.
It visualizes key performance metrics and trends for a company that provides hourly professional services across multiple regions.

The dashboard offers an interactive overview of total revenue and total hours worked, with detailed analysis by department, client, region, and month.
Using SQL queries for data aggregation and Power BI visuals such as bar charts, donut charts, and line graphs, the data was transformed into meaningful business insights.
